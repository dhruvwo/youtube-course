# Productivity Hooks

We have following list of hooks to improve productivity and optimizing code quality:-

### useToggle

To manage toggle values (We can manage state update/toggle with less code)

### useEventListener

To subscribe window events (We can subscribe any window events with less code)

### useScreenSize

To render component on screen size change (We can manage display grid, set dynamic height/width of image/video, we can manage show more hide etc...)

### useScreenSizeDebounce

To render component AFTER screen size change (We can manage all things described in "useScreenSize" but can reduce rerender by triggering it with some debounce)

### useFetch

To Fetch data from backend with loader, success and error messages managed (This will save some time in the case of multiple API calls)

### useIsVisible

To indicate if element is visible on the screen (Based on this we can manage some animations, video play pause, loading image only if element is visible, some dynamic calculations etc...)
